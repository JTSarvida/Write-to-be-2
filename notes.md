# Things that need to be done:

## Research some things not taught through Flatiron

- learn how to make a likes system
- learn how to make a friends system

## Things I cannot implement with current skillset.

- Likes system: Can't do this because the methods I have researched are only done through Ruby on Rails and AJAX.

- Friends system: Currently using a rails tutorial to see if it will be achievable through ruby only. However, even if it works, still isn't completely what I want because I want a like between two users to open up the option for friendship.

## Things I want to done once basic functionality is done.

- Create a layout.erb
- Get some css going
